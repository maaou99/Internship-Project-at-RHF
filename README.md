# Internship-Project-at-RHF
Website created in collaboration with Creative Director Rad Hourani

Please note the idea behind this project, as well as the concept of the user design flow, was purely conceived by Rad Hourani. My job was to code each component and assist with any technical difficulties. I do not identify as the founder of this website. All artistic pieces and descriptions were removed solely for copyright purposes, as my intention is only to display front-end web development skills.
